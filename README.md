# GovTechEmployeeTraining

## Abstract
The success or failure of technological solutions within a professional organization or public institution is dependent on many factors going into the project itself. Variables as diverse as process, governance, financial investment, and executive sponsorship have direct influence. An often-overlooked factor, however, is the readiness of human resources beyond the simple communication of upcoming changes.

Employee training, though often included as part of the scope of overall management practices, has not been examined in depth in terms of its direct influence on the success of an organization as measured by that organizationâ€™s performance or the measured success of individual projects. 

In this project, I attempt to demonstrate a direct relationship between the investment in training individuals on new technology and the success of those technological solutions for the organization as whole, and for individual solutions or projects completed. More specifically, through the analysis of survey data collected by the World Bank Group, I will examine the hypothesis that training has a positive impact on organizational success and on the outcome of specific projects.
